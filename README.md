- Hello visitor, my name is Fernando Alfaro and and I'm a software developer engineer, I'm from Costa Rica and the it's dangerous so look this.

Most of my experience is focused on financial industry (ACH, Bank Information, security)

I'd like to learn a lot, by my self and from other people and as you assumed I like to ask a lot.

I want to be a Architect Developer, but it's hard, by the way I currently working on myself to be it.

Talking about me, I'm the kind of person that want to make the perfect project no matter what, but from the other side I am a person who is very afraid of failure, disappointing someone who trusts me is something horrible for me, even so I try to correct my mistakes improving every day.
